"""Generate test data for ecp functions.

With no arguments, generate all test data. With non-option arguments,
generate only the specified files.

Class structure:

Child classes of test_data_generation.BaseTarget (file targets) represent an output
file. These indicate where test cases will be written to, for all subclasses of
this target. Multiple file targets should not reuse a `target_basename`.

Each subclass derived from a file target can either be:
  - A concrete class, representing a test function, which generates test cases.
  - An abstract class containing shared methods and attributes, not associated
        with a test function.

Both concrete and abstract subclasses can be derived from, to implement
additional test cases (see BignumCmp and BignumCmpAbs for examples of deriving
from abstract and concrete classes).


Adding test case generation for a function:

A subclass representing the test function should be added, deriving from a
file target such as BignumTarget. This test class must set/implement the
following:
  - test_function: the function name from the associated .function file.
  - test_name: a descriptive name or brief summary to refer to the test
        function.
  - arguments(): a method to generate the list of arguments required for the
        test_function.
  - generate_function_tests(): a method to generate TestCases for the function.
        This should create instances of the class with required input data, and
        call `.create_test_case()` to yield the TestCase.

Additional details and other attributes/methods are given in the documentation
of BaseTarget in test_data_generation.py.
