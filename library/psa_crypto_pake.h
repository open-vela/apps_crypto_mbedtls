/** Set the session information for a password-authenticated key exchange.
 *
 * The sequence of operations to set up a password-authenticated key exchange
 * is as follows:
 * -# Allocate an operation object which will be passed to all the functions
 *    listed here.
 * -# Initialize the operation object with one of the methods described in the
 *    documentation for #psa_pake_operation_t, e.g.
 *    #PSA_PAKE_OPERATION_INIT.
 * -# Call psa_pake_setup() to specify the cipher suite.
 * -# Call \c psa_pake_set_xxx() functions on the operation to complete the
 *    setup. The exact sequence of \c psa_pake_set_xxx() functions that needs
 *    to be called depends on the algorithm in use.
 *
 * Refer to the documentation of individual PAKE algorithm types (`PSA_ALG_XXX`
 * values of type ::psa_algorithm_t such that #PSA_ALG_IS_PAKE(\c alg) is true)
 * for more information.
 *
 * A typical sequence of calls to perform a password-authenticated key
 * exchange:
 * -# Call psa_pake_output(operation, #PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...) to get the
 *    key share that needs to be sent to the peer.
 * -# Call psa_pake_input(operation, #PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...) to provide
 *    the key share that was received from the peer.
 * -# Depending on the algorithm additional calls to psa_pake_output() and
 *    psa_pake_input() might be necessary.
 * -# Call psa_pake_get_implicit_key() for accessing the shared secret.
 *
 * Refer to the documentation of individual PAKE algorithm types (`PSA_ALG_XXX`
 * values of type ::psa_algorithm_t such that #PSA_ALG_IS_PAKE(\c alg) is true)
 * for more information.
 *
 * If an error occurs at any step after a call to psa_pake_setup(),
 * the operation will need to be reset by a call to psa_pake_abort(). The
 * application may call psa_pake_abort() at any time after the operation
 * has been initialized.
 *
 * After a successful call to psa_pake_setup(), the application must
 * eventually terminate the operation. The following events terminate an
 * operation:
 * - A call to psa_pake_abort().
 * - A successful call to psa_pake_get_implicit_key().
 *
 * \param[in,out] operation     The operation object to set up. It must have
 *                              been initialized but not set up yet.

 *                              characterizes a PAKE algorithm and determines

 *         PAKE algorithm, or the hash algorithm in \p cipher_suite is invalid
 *         or not compatible with the PAKE algorithm and primitive.

 *         \p cipher_suite is not supported or not compatible with the PAKE
