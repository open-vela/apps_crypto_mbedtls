Bugfix
    * Workaround #6623. That is time unit issue. The unit of ticket age is
      seconds in MBedTLS and milliseconds in GnuTLS. If the real age is 10ms,
      it might be 1s(1000ms), as a result, the age of MBedTLS is greater than
      GnuTLS server. Reduce 1 if the age is greater than 1 second to workaround
      it.
