   * An adversary with access to precise enough timing information (typically, a
     co-located process) could recover a Curve25519 or Curve448 static ECDH key
     after inputting a chosen public key and observing the victim performing the
     corresponding private-key operation. Found and reported by Leila Batina,
     Lukas Chmielewski, Bj√∂rn Haase, Niels Samwel and Peter Schwabe.
