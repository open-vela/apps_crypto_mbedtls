Bugfix
   * Fix a build bug : when parallel out-of-box build with cmake, it raise file
     not found error. That's due to same target is included in different sub-
     makefiles. And cmake will call the targets in different forked `make`
     process. As a result, the dependancy will be broken. This fix remove the
     targets in sub-makefiles and create a global target for it.
