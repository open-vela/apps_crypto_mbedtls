   * Fix a potential heap buffer overread in TLS 1.2 server-side when
     MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO is enabled, an opaque key (created with
     mbedtls_pk_setup_opaque()) is provisioned, and a static ECDH ciphersuite
     is selected. This may result in an application crash. No path to
     information leak has been identified.
