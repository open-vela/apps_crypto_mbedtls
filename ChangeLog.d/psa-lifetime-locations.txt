Default behavior changes
   * In the experimental PSA secure element interface, change the encoding of
     key lifetimes to encode a persistence level and the location. Although C
     prototypes do not effectively change, code calling
     psa_register_se_driver() must be modified to pass the driver's location
     instead of the keys' lifetime. If the library is upgraded on an existing
     device, keys created with the old lifetime value will not be readable or
     removable through Mbed TLS after the upgrade.
