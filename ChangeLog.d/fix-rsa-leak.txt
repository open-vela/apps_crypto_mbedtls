   * An adversary with access to precise enough information about memory
     accesses (typically, an untrusted operating system attacking a secure
     enclave) could recover an RSA private key after observing the victim
     performing a single private-key operation. Found and reported by
     Zili KOU, Wenjian HE, Sharad Sinha, and Wei ZHANG.
