Bugfix
   * Add additional bounds checks in ssl_write_client_hello() preventing
     output buffer overflow if the configuration declared a buffer that was
     too small.
Changes
   * Abort the ClientHello writing function as soon as some extension doesn't
     fit into the record buffer. Previously, such extensions were silently
     dropped. As a consequence, the TLS handshake now fails when the output
     buffer is not large enough to hold the ClientHello.
