Features
    * Add the LMS post-quantum-safe stateful-hash asymmetric signature scheme
      as defined in RFC8554 and NIST.SP.200-208. This currently only supports
      one parameter set (LMS_SHA256_M32_H10), meaning that each private key can
      be used to sign 1024 messages. As such, it is not intended for use in TLS,
      but instead for verification of assets transmitted over an insecure
      channel, particularly firmware images. This is one of the signature
      schemes recommended by the IETF draft SUIT standard for IOT firmware
      upgrades (RFC9019).
    * Add the LM-OTS post-quantum-safe one-time signature scheme, which is
      required for LMS. This can be used independently, but each key can only be
      used to sign one message so is impractical for most circumstances.
