   * Move alt helpers and definitions.
     Various helpers and definitions available for use in alt implementations
     have been moved out of the include/ directory and into the library/
     directory. The files concerned are ecp_internal.h and rsa_internal.h
     which have also been renamed to ecp_alt.h and rsa_alt_helpers.h
     respectively.
