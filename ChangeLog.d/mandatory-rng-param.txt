API changes
   * For all functions that take an RNG parameter, this parameter is now
     mandatory (that is, NULL is not an acceptable value). Functions which
     previously accepted NULL and now reject it are: the X.509 CRT and CSR
     writing functions; the PK sign and decrypt function; the RSA encrypt,
     decrypt, sign and private functions; the function in DHM and ECDH that
     compute the share secret; the scalar multiplication functions in ECP.
   * The following functions now require an RNG parameter:
     mbedtls_ecp_check_pub_priv(), mbedtls_pk_check_pair(),
     mbedtls_pk_parse_key(), mbedtls_pk_parse_keyfile().
   * The configuration option MBEDTLS_ECP_NO_INTERNAL_RNG has been removed as
     it no longer had any effect.
