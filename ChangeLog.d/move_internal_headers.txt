API changes
   * Move internal headers.
     All internal headers have been moved to library/ to unify them in one
     location that is separate from the public API. This includes some files
     that were previously not explicitly internal such as: `bn_mul.h`,
     `aesni.h`, `padlock.h` and `entropy_poll.h`.
