Security
   * Fix side channel in RSA private key operations and static (finite-field)
     Diffie-Hellman. An adversary with precise enough timing and memory access
     information (typically an untrusted operating system attacking a secure
     enclave) could bypass an existing counter-measure (base blinding) and
     potentially fully recover the private key.
