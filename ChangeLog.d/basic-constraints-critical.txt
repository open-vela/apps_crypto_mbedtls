Bugfix
   * This change makes 'mbedtls_x509write_crt_set_basic_constraints'
     consistent with RFC 5280 4.2.1.9 which says: "Conforming CAs MUST
     include this extension in all CA certificates that contain public keys
     used to validate digital signatures on certificates and MUST mark the
     extension as critical in such certificates." Previous to this change,
     the extension was always marked as non-critical. This was fixed by
     #3698.
