Security
   * Add the platform function mbedtls_setbuf() to allow buffering to be
     disabled on stdio files, to stop secrets loaded from said files being
     potentially left in memory after file operations. Reported by
     Glenn Strauss.
Requirement changes
   * The library will no longer compile out of the box on a platform without
     setbuf() if MBEDTLS_FS_IO is enabled. If your platform does not have
     setbuf(), you can configure an alternative function by enabling
     MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_SETBUF_ALT or MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_SETBUF_MACRO.
