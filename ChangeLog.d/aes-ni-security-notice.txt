Security
   * MBEDTLS_AESNI_C, which is enabled by default, was silently ignored on
     builds that couldn't compile the GCC-style assembly implementation
     (most notably builds with Visual Studio), leaving them vulnerable to
     timing side-channel attacks. There is now an intrinsics-based AES-NI
     implementation as a fallback for when the assembly one cannot be used.
