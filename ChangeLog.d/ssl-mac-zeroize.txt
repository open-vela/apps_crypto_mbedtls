Security
   * Zeroize intermediate variables used to calculate the MAC in CBC cipher
     suites. This hardens the library in case stack memory leaks through a
     memory disclosure vulnerabilty, which could formerly have allowed a
     man-in-the-middle to inject fake ciphertext into a DTLS connection.
