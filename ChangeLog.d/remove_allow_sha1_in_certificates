Removals
   * Remove the MBEDTLS_TLS_DEFAULT_ALLOW_SHA1_IN_CERTIFICATES
     compile-time option, which was off by default. Users should not trust
     certificates signed with SHA-1 due to the known attacks against SHA-1.
     If needed, SHA-1 cerificate can still be used by providing custom
     verification profile to mbedtls_x509_crt_verify_with_profile function
     in x509_crt.h, or mbedtls_ssl_conf_cert_profile function in ssl.h.
     Example of custom verification profile, supporting SHA-1:
     const mbedtls_x509_crt_profile mbedtls_x509_crt_custom = {
         MBEDTLS_X509_ID_FLAG( MBEDTLS_MD_SHA1 ),
         0xFFFFFFF, /* Any PK alg    */
         0xFFFFFFF, /* Any curve     */
         2048
     };
