Removals
   * Remove optional SHA-1 in the default TLS configuration for certificate
     signing. This feature was ment to be available only temporarily.
     Users are expected to use SHA-2 instead, since SHA-1 is currently
     considered a security risk.
     If needed, SHA-1 cerificate can still be used by providing custom
     verification profile to mbedtls_x509_crt_verify_with_profile function
     in x509_crt.h, or mbedtls_ssl_conf_cert_profile function in ssl.h.
     Example of custom verification profile, supporting SHA-1:
     const mbedtls_x509_crt_profile mbedtls_x509_crt_custom = {
         MBEDTLS_X509_ID_FLAG( MBEDTLS_MD_SHA1 ),
         0xFFFFFFF, /* Any PK alg    */
         0xFFFFFFF, /* Any curve     */
         2048
     };
