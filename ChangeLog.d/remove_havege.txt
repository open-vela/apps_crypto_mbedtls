   * Remove HAVEGE module.
     The design of HAVEGE makes it unsuitable for microcontrollers. Platforms with a more complex
     CPU usually have an operating system interface that provides better randomness.
     Instead of HAVEGE, declare OS or hardware RNG interfaces with mbedtls_entropy_add_source()
     and/or use an entropy seed file created securely during device provisioning.
     See https://tls.mbed.org/kb/how-to/add-entropy-sources-to-entropy-pool for more information.
