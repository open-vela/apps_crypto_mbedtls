Bugfix
   * Fix mbedtls_mpi_sub_abs() to account for the possibility that the output
     pointer could equal the first input pointer and if so to skip a memcpy()
     call that would be redundant.  Reported by Pascal Cuoq using TrustInSoft
     Analyzer in #6701; observed independently by Aaron Ucko under Valgrind.
