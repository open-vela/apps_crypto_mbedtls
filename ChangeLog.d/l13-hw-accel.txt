   * Fix issue in Lucky 13 counter-measure that could make it ineffective when
     hardware accelerators were used (using one of the MBEDTLS_SHAxxx_ALT
     macros). This would cause the original Lucky 13 attack to be possible in
     those configurations, allowing an active network attacker to recover
     plaintext after repeated timing measurements under some conditions.
     Reported and fix suggested by Luc Perneel in #3246.
