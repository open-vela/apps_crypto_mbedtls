Bugfix
  * In PEM writing functions, fill the trailing part of the buffer with null
    bytes. This guarantees that the corresponding parsing function can read
    the buffer back, which was the case for mbedtls_x509write_{crt,csr}_pem
    until this property was inadvertently broken in Mbed TLS 2.19.0.
    Fixes #3682.
