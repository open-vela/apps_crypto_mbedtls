API changes
    * Modify semantics of `mbedtls_ssl_conf_[opaque_]psk()`:
      In Mbed TLS 2.X, the API prescribes that later calls overwrite
      the effect of earlier calls, implying that there can be at most one
      statically configured PSK. In Mbed TLS 3.X, multiple invocations of
      `mbedtls_ssl_conf_[opaque_]psk()` can be attempted to register
      multiple PSKs. Once an implementation-defined limit of PSKs
      is reached, the functions ignore the request to add
      further PSKs and fail non-fatally.
