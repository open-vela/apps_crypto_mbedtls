    * Fix a buffer overread in TLS 1.3 Certificate parsing. An unauthenticated
      client or server could cause an MbedTLS server or client to overread up
      to 64 kBytes of data and potentially overread the input buffer by that
      amount minus the size of the input buffer. As overread data undergoes
      various checks, the likelihood of reaching the boundary of the input
      buffer is rather small but increases as its size
      MBEDTLS_SSL_IN_CONTENT_LEN decreases.
