Changes
   * Always store key bits attribute in PSA key storage. Previously stored
     keys should be augmented with the bits value to be compatible with the
     updated version. #3740
   * Removes the stored bits field from the storage format for the
     dynamic Secure Element driver. Previously stored keys must be updated to
     remove the stored bits field. #3740
