Changes
   * PSA persistent storage format is updated to always store the key bits
     attribute. No automatic upgrade path is provided. Previously stored keys
     must be erased, or manually upgraded based on the key storage format
     specification (mbed-crypto-storage-specification.md). The storage format
     for the dynamic Secure Element driver has also been updated. Previously
     stored keys must be erased, or manually upgraded. #3740
