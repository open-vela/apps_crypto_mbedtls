# Doxygen accepts empty descriptions for commands such as \retval,
# but clang -Wdocumentation doesn't (since Clang 15, for \retval).

# We often use \retval declarations with just a constant name to
# document which error codes a function can return. If the documentation
# of the error code is enough to explain the error, then an empty
# description on the \retval statement is ok. However, the source code
# of the description needs to be made non-empty to pacify Clang.
# In such cases, you can write something like
#     \retval #PSA_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY \emptydescription
# This does not change the documentation generated by Doxygen, but
# it pacifies clang -Wdocumentation.
